# Project Overview

The entertainment industry increasingly relies on audience feedback to evaluate film quality, marketing effectiveness, and creative direction. While numerical ratings offer a general view of viewer satisfaction, they fail to capture nuanced opinions about specific aspects such as acting, plot, directing, or cinematography. Manual review analysis is infeasible at scale, especially when thousands of reviews are posted daily across streaming and review platforms.

# Obejectives

This project seeks to apply advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to automatically identify and classify audience sentiment from textual movie reviews while distinguishing which film aspects drive positive or negative opinions. The goal is to move beyond traditional binary classification and develop a fine-grained sentiment analysis model capable of extracting both overall sentiment and aspect-level opinions. The findings will provide actionable insights that can help production studios, streaming services, and film analysts better understand audience perceptions and improve creative and marketing strategies.
