# ENERGY CONSUMPTION PREDICTIVE MODEL
    
## By Joseph Choi | Jenny Overby | Daniel Meier | Serge Nane

In today’s world, energy sustainability has long been an important topic of discussion as it directly impacts the health of our planet and the quality of life for current and future generations. Therefore, optimizing and conserving energy consumption has been globally prioritized as an essential goal in combating climate change, preserving natural resources, and encouraging people to care for the environment for a more sustainable future (Zaharia et al., 2019). One way to contribute and support sustainability is by making changes in our own homes (Chen et al., 2023). For instance, reducing energy usage by turning off lights and appliances when not in use can make a difference in conserving resources and protecting the environment (Debebe et al., 2023). Taking these concerns into consideration, our project’s objective is to address them using data analysis and data science methodologies.

The core of our project revolves around two fundamental research questions:
1.	What are the key indicators or factors influencing energy consumption?
2.	Can we accurately predict future energy consumption in buildings using historical usage data?

## RAW Data:
