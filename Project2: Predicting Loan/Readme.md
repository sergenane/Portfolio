## Overview

This project applies **machine learning** to predict loan default risk using customer demographic and financial indicators.  
The primary goal is to help financial institutions make smarter and fairer credit decisions while minimizing losses from undetected defaulters.

Two machine learning algorithms — **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** — were trained, evaluated, and compared to identify which approach provides the best balance between predictive accuracy, recall, and interpretability.

## Objectives

- Predict whether a borrower will default on a loan based on profile data.  
- Compare **Logistic Regression** (interpretable) vs **Random Forest** (non-linear, high accuracy).  
- Identify which borrower characteristics most influence default risk.  
- Apply ethical AI practices, ensuring fairness and transparency in financial modeling.
