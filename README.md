## About Me

My journey into data science started in the world of Sales Operations, where I worked closely with sales performance metrics, forecasting trends, and supporting strategic decisions. While working in that role, I developed a deep curiosity for data—how it behaves, what it reveals, and how it can be used to solve real business problems.  

That curiosity evolved into a passion for analytics and machine learning, ultimately leading me to pursue both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Data Science. Since then, I’ve built multiple end-to-end projects applying classification, prediction, NLP, and time series forecasting techniques to real datasets across different industries.

I enjoy the challenge of turning raw, messy data into meaningful insights, building models that help decision-makers, and continuously learning new tools and methods. My work is driven by three core principles: **clarity, accuracy, and impact**.

Today, I am committed to leveraging data to improve processes, support informed decisions, and create measurable value—whether through analytics, modeling, or thoughtful data storytelling.
